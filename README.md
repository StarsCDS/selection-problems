# Problems

## Instructions

  - Solve the problem assigned to you among the below listed problems and upload all your code and artefacts in a github repository and share its link. Make sure the repository is public.

## Problem 1 : Data Science Challenge

  - **Goal**: Predictive modeling and data visualization.
  - **Task**: 
    - Visualize the relation between features (you can design your own new features based on the given data)
	- Develop an ML model which, given the name of a director, predicts the release year of his next movie along with its probable genres
  - **Output**: A GitHub repository with code, report or presentation that includes insights, methodologies, and conclusions.
  - **Evaluation**: Accuracy of predictions, creativity in approach, clarity of presentation, and depth of insights.

  - **Data**: **Movie Metadata** ([./data/p1_movie_metadata.csv](./data/p1_movie_metadata.csv))

## Problem 2 : Data Engineering Challenge (:TODO:)

  - **Goal**: Data pipeline construction or optimization.
  - **Task**: Design a data pipeline that ingests, processes, and outputs data in an efficient manner. Optionally, include aspects like real-time data processing or handling large-scale data.
  - **Output**: A working prototype or detailed architecture proposal.
  - **Evaluation**: Efficiency, scalability, and innovation in the designed pipeline.

## Problem 3 : Machine Learning Engineering Challenge

  - **Goal**: Build a machine learning model and deploy it.
  - **Task**: Develop a machine learning model (image classification) based on provided data and deploy it as a simple web application or API.
  - **Output**: A GitHub repository with code, usage documentation and a live demo (could be a simple web page).
  - **Evaluation**: Performance of the model, code quality, and usability of the deployment.

  - **Data**: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html (use the CIFAR-10 version)
